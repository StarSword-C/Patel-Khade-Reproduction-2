# Battery State-of-Health (SOH) Estimation — Patel & Khade (2024) Reproduction
**Author:** Aaron J. Davis  
**Course:** ECE 57000 – Artificial Intelligence - Purdue University at West Lafayette
**Checkpoint 2 (Fall 2025)**

---

## 📘 Overview
This MATLAB project reproduces the experiment described by  **[“State of Health Estimation for Lithium-Ion Batteries Based on Charging Curve and Machine Learning.”](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMPS60684.2024.10559327)**

The goal is to verify that simple **time-to-voltage** features extracted from **CC–CV** charging data can accurately predict **battery State of Health (SOH)**.

The project uses the [**Oxford Battery Degradation Dataset 1**](https://dx.doi.org/10.5287/bodleian:KO2kdmYGg), which provides complete time-series voltage, charge, and temperature traces across multiple cells and characterization cycles.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Fully automated MATLAB pipeline**
  - Extracts six time-domain features (F₁–F₆) from each charge cycle.  
  - Calculates SOH from discharge capacity relative to nominal or first-cycle reference.  
  - Evaluates each feature via independent linear regression.  
  - Produces metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R²) and regression plots.
- **Two-pass, no-growth design** — clean execution without analyzer warnings.  
- **Dataset-agnostic utilities** — reusable for other Li-ion aging datasets.

## Feature explanation

| Feature | Description                        | Units   | Physical Meaning                                                                                                                                                   |
| :------ | :--------------------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **F₁**  | **Cycle index**                    | —       | Identifier of which charge/discharge cycle is being analyzed (used for tracking degradation trends).                                                               |
| **F₂**  | **Constant-current (CC) duration** | seconds | Time from the start of charging until voltage first reaches $V_{\max} - 0.05~\mathrm{V}$, marking the end of the CC phase. Healthy cells have longer CC durations. |
| **F₃**  | **Constant-voltage (CV) duration** | seconds | Time from the CC→CV knee to the end of charging; aged cells spend more relative time here because current decays faster.                                           |
| **F₄**  | **Time to 3.9 V**                  | seconds | Elapsed time from start of charge until the cell reaches 3.9 V.                                                                                                    |
| **F₅**  | **Time to 4.0 V**                  | seconds | Elapsed time from start of charge until 4.0 V; this typically gives the strongest correlation with SOH.                                                            |
| **F₆**  | **Time to 4.1 V**                  | seconds | Elapsed time from start of charge until 4.1 V; similar trend as F₅, slightly more affected by noise near the CV knee.                                              |

## predictPBKNN.rar

This zip contains an example bilayered neural network generated using F₂ and F₄-F₆ using Regression Learner. My original goal for my thesis work revolved around machine learning models that would fit on microcontrollers (particularly a TI C2000 series) that can be used in offline battery management systems.
